    Here are some examples of Mapbox that I liked:
    
<div class="column">	
  <img src="hurricanemap.PNG" style="width:80%;height:300px;">
	</div>
    <p1> This image is a screen shot of a hurricane map by Urbica Design that I found very interesting. This would be super useful to track hurricane patterns
      and can help weather stations make predictions for future conditions. I really like the contrasting colors of this map which really allows the 
      hurricane paths to stand out. It also is so simple with really just a lot of lines, but it looks so complex and really overall just gets the idea
      across to the viewer in a succinct and colorful way.</p1>
    
    <div class="column">	
  <img src="oystermap.PNG" style="width:80%;height:300px;">
	</div>
  <p2> This image is a screenshot of oyster species and regions where they are located by Roderick Chow. I really like how this map resembles a heat map
    and, similarly to the map above, the contrast of the map really allows the points of interest to stand out. I could see using a map like this for my
    final project and I just might.
    
    <div class="column">
  <img src="bikesmap.PNG" style="width:80%;height:300px;">
	</div>
    <p3>This image is a creenshot of "Moves Map" by Tatiana Van Campenhout. It highlights the modes of transportation such as walking, running, and 
      driving. This would be very useful for regional planners to see where would be good areas for parks, new bike paths and routes, etc. 
      I really like how they were able to fit so much data on the map and yet still make it look clean and neat.</p3>
    
    <p4> If I were to use this tool to make a map in the future, I would try and make something similar to the Oyster map. I feel like this map 
      describes the habitat area very well which is what I am looking to do in my final project. I would like to use a black/night looking background 
      and a bright color which would make the areas stand out. I also could see using this tool in a regional planning job to highlight areas of interest as well.
      Symbols and lines would work better for that type of project with a street basemap.
